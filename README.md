### About Project
The project PERSONAL RESTAURANT GUIDE enables users to create a customized list of their restaurants allowing them to rate them and get directions from their current location using Google Maps.

### Challenges/Issues:
Google Maps API - not another screen within the app but takes you to Google Maps

Details Screen - The details screen is not properly implemented and not displayed

Description  - Cannot be added  with the form currently available

### Version Control:
We did not do version control on GitHub but sent the application to each other through snack expo. 

### Conclusion
There were difficulties faced in the creation and implementation of the application but we made a decent application with a base we can work off and improve on when we review React Native functionalities again.
